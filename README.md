# Othello Bot v2

A high-performance, bitboard-based Othello (Reversi) engine in Python, accelerated with Numba JIT and parallel root-search. Plays up to 10 minutes per game, supports opening books, undo, and configurable move-generation backends.

## üöÄ Features

- **Bitboard core** (`board.py`) for ultra-fast state updates
- **Negamax + Œ±-Œ≤ pruning** with:
  - Iterative deepening
  - Principal-variation move ordering
  - Aspiration windows
  - Transposition table
  - (Optional) Killer-move heuristic
- **Numba-JIT move generator** (`jit_utils.py`) ‚Äî‚Äî ~10√ó faster than pure-Python
- **Parallel root search** (via `ProcessPoolExecutor`) to leverage all CPU cores
- **Time management** (`TimeManager`) with safety margin
- **Opening book** support (plies 0‚Äì3 from `book.json`)
- **CLI** (`engine.py`) with human vs. bot, undo, stop, and board display
- **Test suite** (`test_moves.py`, `test_jit_moves.py`) ensuring correctness
- **Benchmark scripts** (`compare_speed.py`, `benchmark_search.py`) for profiling

## üì¶ Installation

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/othellobot_v2.git
   cd othellobot_v2
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**

   ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Run the command-line interface:
```bash
python engine.py
```
Follow the prompts to choose sides and play against the engine. Type `undo` to revert the last move or `stop` to exit.

Prefer a windowed interface? Launch the Tkinter GUI:
```bash
python ui.py
```
Click on highlighted squares to play your moves.
